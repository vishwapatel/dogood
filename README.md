# Welcome to [DoGood](http://dogood.herokuapp.com) #

[DoGood](http://dogood.herokuapp.com) is an app that lets you create pledges to do something good within a month and let's other users who follow you see all the pledges you've made in the last month. You can create a user profile with an profile picture (achieved through Paperclip gem + Amazon S3) and other people can search for you and choose to follow you, in which case they will be able to see the pledges you've made in the last month (recent pledges). User authentication is handled through Devise. When you edit a user you will be asked to sign in again to confirm your identity. The app also uses AJAX to create new pledges. The ability to follow a user was implemented by using the 'acts_as_follower' gem. Once you've created a pledge you can edit it or delete it.
